# Brain-Tumor-Prediction-Project

üß† Brain Tumor Prediction using CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify brain MRI images and predict the presence of a brain tumor. The deep learning model is trained on labeled MRI scans to distinguish between tumor and non-tumor cases with high accuracy.

üîç Key Features:
Deep Learning Model: Uses a CNN architecture for image classification.
Preprocessing: Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation for better model performance.
Dataset: Brain MRI images from kaggle.
Training & Evaluation: Model trained using Keras.
